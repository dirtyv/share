# share
A python program that creates a simple webserver in order to share text on your local network

This program will prompt the user for a string of text and then create a local webpage displaying that text as both a link and a text box element with the text inside it, ready for copying. The program will prompt the user for a file name, which will allow them to save the resultant html file. This will also cause the program to serve up the entire current folder. When no file name is chosen, it will be saved as 'index.html', and the server will serve up just this html file instead of the whole folder. Also, if this default option is chosen, the file will be automatically deleted at the end of execution.
